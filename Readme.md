# JAVA
``` 
1. Java is a Compiled/Interpreted Language. 
    1.1 Compiled means "Compiler is a program that convert the program into machine language, so that computer processor can execute it".
        -   Code can be executed directed by cpu.
        -   Run Faster || Better Performance.
        -   if error occur at comile time then it will not convert the source code into machine language. 
        
    1.2 Interpreter means "it reads line by line of code and then execute it directly".
        -   Code can be executed by another program. like JS code execute in browser, Python code execute in Anaconda and so on.
        -   Slower || Faster for Developement.   
        
2. Working:-
    Java has JVM. 
        the source code is compiled into Byte Code, then JVM interpreted the byte code & then execute it. 
                          Compiled               Interpreted
            SOURCE CODE     ==>      Byte Code      ==>         EXECUTE/ EXE.
            
3.  Type Checking:-
    3.1 Static:-
        -   it occur at compile time.
        -   Java is Statically-Typed check language. 
    3.2 Dynamic:-
        -   it occur at run time.
        
4.  JDK:-
        for download JDK use Eclipse Temurin (AdoptOpenJDK HotSpot) 17.0.4.1  for intel/Amd machine, not download aarch64.
